# Hybrid Collisional-Radiative/Molecular Dynamics

This is a Hybrid Collisional-Radiative/Molecular Dynamics (CR/MD) model that is part of the MOLDSTRUCT toolbox. It can be used to simulate photon-matter interaction for large systems such as protein large macromolecules, protein crystals and liquids. The code is based on a modified version of ([webpage](https://www.gromacs.org/)) version 4.5. With functionality close to the normal GROMACS but with some additional parameters to control ionization. Running the code requires data regarding the charge distribution, free electron temperature/density and optionally electron-ion coupling. The model is developed by the Biophysics group at Uppsala University and has a preprint here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03180.
